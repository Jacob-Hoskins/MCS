                    <p class="main-font">MC Schedule software allows shows you how many jobs you have going on at once, and still keeps the job details seperate and easy to understand. You`re even able to compare jobs that are happening at the same time to help prioratize and figure out what needs done where.</p>

                <div class="grabber-3A">
                    <p class="main-font">When it`s time to worry about the hours you have on the job MC Schedule can take care of that too. Your employees have a virtual time clock so you`ll be able to just click on the job and see the total number of hours you have in it so far. You`ll also be able to see your employee`s weekly hours.</p>
